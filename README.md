**Fundamentals of Computer Programming (C Language)**

This is a comprehensive course repository for Tsinghua University's "Fundamentals of Computer Programming" course. The course focuses on programming concepts and covers C language multi-file organization, macros, command-line arguments, and more.

As a non-CS major student with no prior programming experience, this was my introductory programming course.

## Course Overview

This course emphasizes programming design principles over complex algorithms. It serves as an excellent starting point for beginners looking to build a strong foundation in computer programming.

## Course Structure

### Exams
- **Format**: 3 written examinations
- **Content**: Heavy emphasis on C language syntax details
- **Additional**: Algorithm design bonus questions

### Programming Assignments (PA)
- **Quantity**: 10 Online Judge (OJ) assignments
- **Focus**: Syntax mastery and practical implementation
- **Platform**: Online Judge system

### Course Project
- **Description**: First complete programming project
- **Technology**: EasyX graphics library for UI
- **Repository**: [UNO-card-game-EasyX](https://github.com/wannabeyourfriend/UNO-card-game-EasyX)

> **Note**: The code style in the project repository reflects early programming work and would benefit from refactoring based on current best practices.

## Learning Resources
